## What's special about this Pathfinding Visualizer?

It was made by using my own library to make canvas interactions easier! You can check it out [@wCanvas's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/wCanvas).

## What do the colours mean?

There are 6 different colours:
 - **RED** -> start (The starting point)
 - **YELLOW** -> goal (The end point)
 - **BLUE** -> calculating (The cell that is being calculated)
 - **GRAY** -> searched (Already searched cells)
 - **GREEN** -> path (The path to the end)
 - **WHITE** -> obstacles (Walls)

## How do I generate a new path to calculate?

You can press **R** to create a new path (You can only create a path once the old one is fully calculated, or you can reload the page before generating a new one)
