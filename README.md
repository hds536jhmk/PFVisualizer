## What's special about this Pathfinding Visualizer?

It was made by using my own library to make canvas interactions easier! You can check it out [@wCanvas's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/wCanvas).

## What do the colours mean?

There are 6 different colours:
 - **RED** -> Start (The starting point)
 - **YELLOW** -> Goal (The end point)
 - **BLUE** -> Calculating (The cell that is being calculated)
 - **GRAY** -> Calculated (Already calculated cells)
 - **GREEN** -> Path (The path to the end)
 - **WHITE** -> Obstacles (Walls)

## What are the key bindings for this app?

 - **R** : Generates a new path (can only be done when the old one finished);
 - **H** : Toggles the algorithm selector.
